# prog_fund_final
    A program that asks the user for 3 full names (first and last), as well as 3 numbers for each full name.
      All numbers must be between 85 and 99 - if a number is outside this range, the user is prompted to re-enter until all numbers are accepted.
    The program then processes a function for each full name to calculate a weighted average score using the inputted numbers for each name.
    The weighted average score is determined by multiplying the first number (IQ) by 2, the second (Accuracy) by 1.75, and the third (Power) by 1.5;
      then adding the totals and dividing by the sum of the weights (5.25).
      Finally, the program will display the full names with their individual scores, respective weighted overalls, and overall average of all weighted scores.
    This program represents 3 fictional NFL quarterbacks and their arbitrary traits to analyze how they compare against one another.
